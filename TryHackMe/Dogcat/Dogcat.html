</head><body><p>Hi everyone, today I would like to analyze the machine called <code>dogcat</code> on TryHackMe platform. </p>

<p>Let me add my ipv4 address to <code>/etc/hosts</code> file.</p>

<p><img src="./images/1.png" alt="alt text" /></p>

<h2>Reconnaissance</h2>

<p>I prefer to divide <code>recon</code> phase into two sub category. I will respectively apply both manual &amp; automated reconnaissance in advance.</p>

<ul>
<li>Manual </li>
<li>Automated</li>
</ul>

<h3>Manual Reconnaissance:</h3>

<p>Without using any tool, we can conduct a scan just by taking advantage of the browser. Furthermore, <code>curl</code> also suitable for diverse HTTP methods plus direct port queries.</p>

<p><img src="./images/2.png" alt="alt text" />
As you can see, you should always modify the <code>http://</code> part of the url in every time since every time browser redirects the client to the <code>https</code> protocol working on <code>443</code>.</p>

<p><img src="./images/3.png" alt="alt text" /></p>

<p>In order to verify both the web app instance and web server type, I will check for both web application instance and its type at once through the browser. In this scenario, <code>Apache</code> has been used to make live our application. To understand it, using <code>http</code> with port <code>8080</code> (default Apache port number) is compatible right now.</p>

<ul>
<li>By requesting through <code>curl</code>, we can reach the same result.</li>
</ul>

<p>```</p>

<h1>Testing port 80</h1>

<p>curl http://dogcat.thm:80</p>

<h1>Testing port 8080</h1>

<p>curl http://dogcat.thm:8080
```</p>

<p><img src="./images/4.png" alt="alt text" /></p>

<p>Furthermore, you can also get <code>HTTP header</code> info through <code>-I</code> option.</p>

<p><code>
curl -I http://dogcat.thm:80/8080
</code></p>

<p><img src="./images/5.png" alt="alt text" /></p>

<p>Time reduction is crucial aspect for offensive security operations ,so before you move on conducting port scans via <code>nmap</code>. I highly recommend you to take action on manual part.</p>

<p>Let's check what we have:
<img src="./images/6.png" alt="alt text" /></p>

<p><code>Image generation</code> web application, without the usage of any <code>persistent storage (Database)</code>. After clicking any image, I recognized that we can temper end point parameter just by giving unusual parameter or trigger <code>LFI</code> or <code>RFI</code>. I intentionally tried to click <code>dog</code> button then try to move parent directory using <code>../</code>.</p>

<p><img src="./images/7.png" alt="alt text" /></p>

<p>Now let's execute it on browser's URL part:</p>

<p><img src="./images/8.png" alt="alt text" /></p>

<p>As you can see here, the behavior of the web app altered, normally it should not render upper directory by default. We just delete the <code>?view=</code> part and reach default page. </p>

<p>Anyway, let me also use automated scan.</p>

<h3>Automating</h3>

<p>Nmap provides significant evidence to our roadmap in every CTF session ,but in this scenario I assumed that I should directly get initial compromise on web app.</p>

<p>Payload:
<code>
sudo nmap -sV -sC dogcat.thm
</code></p>

<p><img src="./images/9.png" alt="alt text" /></p>

<p>Payload:
<code>
sudo nmap -sV -sC -p- dogcat.thm
</code>
<img src="./images/10.png" alt="alt text" /></p>

<p>Additionally, I wanted to intercept the <code>view</code> parameter ,so maybe I can trigger <code>path traversal</code> then move on <code>LFI</code>. Let me use a <code>HackTricks</code></p>

<p><a href="https://book.hacktricks.xyz/pentesting-web/file-inclusion">HackTricks - File Inclusion</a></p>

<p><img src="./images/12.png" alt="alt text" /></p>

<p>As you can see below, there was not such file located on correlated path:</p>

<p><img src="./images/11.png" alt="alt text" /></p>

<p>I understood the occurrence of the <code>path traversal</code> since I was able to try to show specific path, <code>../../../../var/www/html/config.php</code> ,but the application behaved in a different manner. In contrast, it applied some additions on last part of the path's ending part.</p>

<p><img src="./images/13.png" alt="alt text" /></p>

<p>To get the idea behind the application (backend), I used really unique file name called <code>ErkanUcar</code>. As you can see above, it is clear that application intended to make file extension addition on any file. In this scenario it applied <code>.php</code>. Maybe there should also a method for escaping <code>.php</code> extension. From that idea, having a bright understanding about <code>LFI</code> is possible. Moreover, the error message genuinely explains whether we have <code>LFI</code> or not. In every attempt, it was executing file + <code>.php</code> extension. </p>

<p>Thanks to <code>Medium</code> known as article publication platform, I easily found what I need especially escaping restrictions on <code>LFI</code>. </p>

<p><img src="./images/14.png" alt="alt text" /></p>

<p>It suggests that If we apply <code>NullByte - %00</code> on last part where url was located, we can directly bypass restriction. On this concept, he or she did not use the advantage of null byte. </p>

<p>Let me apply it:</p>

<p>Payload:</p>

<p><code>
cat/../../../../etc/erkanucar%00
</code></p>

<p><img src="./images/15.png" alt="alt text" /></p>

<p>In every attempt that I made restricted by web application because it was clear that using <code>whitelist</code> approach on words like <code>cat</code> or <code>dog</code> prevents users to inject <code>LFI</code> payload. We can still traverse ,but not execute something useful <code>php</code> file. Furthermore, web application technology is playing crucial role in such cases. Therefore, I checked the web application technology that is used by our instance using <code>wappalyzer</code> and <code>whatweb</code>.</p>

<h3>Whatweb Output:</h3>

<p><img src="./images/16.png" alt="alt text" /></p>

<p>Payload:
<code>whatweb dogcat.thm</code></p>

<h3>Wappalyzer Output:</h3>

<p><img src="./images/17.png" alt="alt text" /></p>

<p>I deliberately gave two approach to fulfill the same result with <code>different tools</code>. Lastly, having a strong foundation on web application fuzzing is necessary in order to discovery phase. In my scenario, since I found <code>LFI</code> vulnerability directly. I would like to reach other endpoints of the web application to increase the efficiency of my <code>LFI</code>.</p>

<h3>Dirsearch Output:</h3>

<p>Payload:</p>

<p><code>
dirsearch -u http://dogcat.thm
</code></p>

<p><img src="./images/18.png" alt="alt text" /></p>

<p>I only got <code>/flag.php</code> path seems to more weird. Why I need to name my <code>php</code> application as flag :)</p>

<h3>Dirb Output:</h3>

<p><img src="./images/19.png" alt="alt text" /></p>

<p>After I make my fuzzing operation, I decided to move on <code>flag.php</code> path. However, it did not render something. Moreover, it was identical that I found another endpoint on <code>view?=dog</code> parameter resulted in <code>Burpsuite Repeater</code></p>

<p><img src="./images/20.png" alt="alt text" /></p>

<p>Now, I will discover them manually. Still I could not reach any useful paths. Now, I prefer to use <a href="https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/tree/master/File%20Inclusion#wrapper-phpfilter">PayloadAllTheThings</a> repo in order to understand what can I achieve on <code>PHP filters</code>.</p>

<p><img src="./images/21.png" alt="alt text" />
It was not too complicated to use <code>php://filter</code> ,but we should give the endpoint direction through our <code>resource=</code> part as a payload. Th
erefore, let me use filters in a legit way.</p>

<p><code>
http://dogcat.thm/?view=php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource=dog
</code></p>

<p><img src="./images/22.png" alt="alt text" /></p>

<p>From my point of view, the application encodes the dog.php via <code>Base64</code> then prompts out the file content. Now it works !</p>

<p>I also wanted to decode it with <code>cyberchef tool</code> to understand what exactly it does.</p>

<p><code>
PGltZyBzcmM9ImRvZ3MvPD9waHAgZWNobyByYW5kKDEsIDEwKTsgPz4uanBnIiAvPg0K
</code></p>

<p><img src="./images/23.png" alt="alt text" /></p>

<p>First of all, <code>PHP</code> code generated numbers from <code>1 to 10</code> then it concatenates generated number with <code>.jpg</code> extension. As you know, we are in the path where it is in the child directory of root. Let's move on <code>index</code> part.</p>

<p><img src="./images/24.png" alt="alt text" /></p>

<p>Extracting <code>index</code> file will be magnificent to understand the entire structure of our web application especially for the backend part.</p>

<p><code>base64</code> encoded server-side file is such:
<code>dogcat.thm/?view=php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource=dog/../index</code></p>

<p>After you reach the page you will encounter a huge formatted random string:
<img src="./images/25.png" alt="alt text" /></p>

<p>You can directly extract from browser's rendered html section. This was what I have extracted so far !</p>

<p><img src="./images/26.png" alt="alt text" /></p>

<p>As a software developer, I thought that  what actions should I take on the backend code on <code>server-side</code>.</p>

<p>Using variable without conditional statements or sanitization mainly causes vulnerability especially in <code>php</code>. That's why, I can tamper the <code>$ext</code> variable so as to modify file extension of the file. I have already verified the usage of <code>php://filter</code> feature then it worked !</p>

<p>Now let me also use variable as a parameter on this scenario:</p>

<p><code>
http://dogcat.thm/?view=php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource=dog/../../../../etc/passwd&amp;ext
</code>
Applying <code>php://filter</code> bypasses <code>cat</code> , <code>dog</code> string and path direction filters ,but not the extension itself. Moreover, <code>null byte</code> also did not work as you know because of the path restrictions. Therefore, it is suitable to use <code>$ext</code> to bypass extension append. Now let's try to move our target route called <code>/etc/passwd</code>.</p>

<p><img src="./images/27.png" alt="alt text" /></p>

<p><img src="./images/28.png" alt="alt text" /></p>

<p>Now we are ready to reach flag ! ! !
As far as I remember, we have also <code>SSH</code> port open. That's why, I will try to use unshadow through <code>/etc/passwd</code> and <code>/etc/shadow</code></p>
