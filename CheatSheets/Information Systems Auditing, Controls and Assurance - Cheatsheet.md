## 1.2 Introduction to Risk in Information System

### What is Risk?

Risk, according to my understanding, is a possibility of having a negative impact.

---

## Elements of Risk

|Element|Description|
|---|---|
|**Threats**|Natural disaster, Man-made threats (internal: fraud, external: hacking), Technical (hardware failure)|
|**Impact**|Measure of damage|
|**Probabilities**|Likelihood of having risk|

### Who can give you the highest damage?

The internal man-made threats are more serious than the external ones because internal person is within the organization and knows your business process, so they can damage you the most compared to external.

> **Key Point:** Internal threats give more damage to the organization than external ones.

## Risk Management Process Overview

What is the process of risk management?

|Step|Process|
|---|---|
|1|Risk Assessment|
|2|Risk Mitigation|
|3|Risk Re-evaluation|

---

## Risk Management Process 1 - Risk Assessment

- Identify area of having high risk
- 3 elements of risk: Threats, Impact, Probabilities

### Step 1: Define Risk

![[risk.png]]

### Step 2: Define the probability of having risk

_e.g. based on historical data_

![[risk2.png]]

### Step 3: Identify the risk for different threats & create the risk matrix

### Step 4: Rate the risk

## Risk Assessment Example

**Risk to your organization**

|Question|Answer|
|---|---|
|What is the threat?|Cyber hacking to online server|
|What is the impact?|4. Serious impact: Operation → Breakdown of key activities leading to reduction in performance|
|What is the probability?|4. Likely → The event will probably occur|

**Multiply on matrix →**

## Risk Management Process 2 - Risk Mitigation

Risk mitigation means reduce the risks using controls.

### Risk Mitigation Example

**How can we reduce the risk of cyber hacking?**

### What are the options if senior management still not happy with the existing risk?

|Option|Description|
|---|---|
|**Transfer the remaining risk to 3rd party**|Insurance Policy|
|**Avoid the risk**|Example: We are a bank and would like to go for e-banking. It seems that e-banking is high risk for organization. We are worrying about the data lost maybe hacking to your customers information. You decided to continue with traditional banking, but no e-banking.|

---

### What is the difference between eliminate the risk and avoid the risk?

|Action|Meaning|
|---|---|
|**Eliminate the risk**|We still go for e-banking and we come up with many many controls and decide, we don't have risks at all.|
|**Avoid the risk**|No, we don't do e-banking, but we do traditional banking only.|

> ⚠️ **Note:** Not doing e-banking leads to lose customer - **DONT PREFERRED**

---

### Risk Mitigation Options Summary

|#|Option|
|---|---|
|1|Reduce the risk using control to a level acceptable by senior management|
|2|Transfer the risk to third party|
|3|Avoid the risk|

> ⚠️ **Remember: Cannot eliminate**

---

## Risk Management Process 3 - Risk Re-evaluation

### When are we doing risk evaluation?

Two different scenarios that we do risk re-evaluation:

|Trigger Type|Description|Example|
|---|---|---|
|**Time Driven**|Periodically - once every six months or once every year|Scheduled assessment|
|**Event Driven**|Environment change (something changed within organisation or similar organisations), government regulation, natural disaster|Japan earthquake (nuclear plant melt down) → environment change example|
