## 1.2 Introduction to Risk in Information System

### What is Risk ?
Risk, according to my understanding, is a possibility of having a negative impact.

### Elements of risk

- **Threats** -> Natural disaster, man-made threats(internal (fraud), external (hacking)), Technical(hardware failure) 
- **Impact** -> Measure of damage
- **Probabilities** -> Likelihood of having risk

**Who can give you the highest damage ?**

*The internal man-made threats are more serious than the external ones because internal person that within the organization and of course your business process, so that they can damage you the most compared to external.

*Internal ones give more damage to the organization than external ones.

#### Risk Management Process 1- Risk Assessment

What is the process of risk management ?

1. Risk Assessment
2. Risk Mitigation
3. Risk re-evaluation

##### Risk Assessment

- Identify area of having high risk
- 3 elements of risk:

-Threats
-Impact
-Probabilities

**Step 1: Define Risk**

![[risk.png]]

**Step 2: Define the probability of having risk**

*e.g. based on historical data*

![[risk2.png]]

**Step 3: Identify the risk for different threats & create the risk matrix**

![[risk3.png]]

**Step 4: Rate the risk**

![[risk4.png]]

### Risk assessment example

Risk to your organization

- What is the threat?

Cyber hacking to online server

- What is the impact?

- What is the probability ?

According to instructor, 4. Serious impact: *Operation -> Breakdown of key activities leading to reduction in performance*, Probability -> *4. Likely -> The event will probably occur*

Multiply on matrix ->

![[risk5.png]]

#### Risk Management Process 2 - Risk Mitigation

Risk mitigation means reduce the risks using controls.

##### Risk mitigation example:

How can we reduce the risk of cyber hacking ?

![[risk6.png]]

![[risk7.png]]


![[risk8.png]]

![[risk9.png]]

What are the options if senior management still not happy with the existing risk?

- **Transfer the remaining risk to 3rd party (Insurance Policy)**

- **Avoid the risk** -> 

Example: we are a bank and would like to go for e-banking. It seems that e-banking is high risk for organization. We are worrying about the data lost maybe hacking to your customers information. You decided to continue with traditional banking ,but no e-banking.

**What is the difference between eliminate the risk and avoid the risk?**

Eliminate the risk means we still go for e-banking and we come up with many many controls and decide, we don't have risks at all. 

Avoid the risk means, no, we don't do e-banking, but we do traditional banking only.

not doing e-banking leads to lose customer DONT PREFERRED.

*1. Reduce the risk using control to a level acceptable by senior management*
*2. Transfer the risk to third party*
*3. Avoid the risk*

**Remember cannot eliminate**

### Risk Management Process 3 - Risk Re-evaluation

**When are we doing risk evaluation?**

Two different scenarios that we do risk re-evaluation.

- **Time Driven** -> Peridocially that means once every six months time we do the risk assessment and risk evaluation or once every year.
- **Event Driven** -> Environment change (Something changed within organisation or similar organisations), government regulation, natural disaster

Japan earthquake (nuclear plant melt down) -> envrionment change example

#### Internal Controls of Information Systems (IS)

#### 1.6 Identify Internal Controls

![[risk10.png]]

**What are internal controls ?**

Policies, procedures, practices and organizational structures implemented to reduce **risks**.

**==Policy & Procedure==**
Every employees must change their usernames and passwords every 3 months.

| Username | Username |
| -------- | -------- |
| johnw123 | johnw456 |

| Passwords   | Passwords |
| ----------- | --------- |
| Dlfhsji!s24 | ovldjhD13 |
**How to implement this policy ?**

![[controls1.png]]

*If no change, staff cannot access to the system*

**Internal Controls:**

1) Policy and procedures
2) Law & regulations from government

**Classification of internal controls**

1. **Preventative Controls** -> If you have antivirus software installed in your computer, whenever there could be some virus attacks to your computer. Your antivirus software is going to prevent that attack.
2. **Detective Controls** -> Sometimes security administrators keep firewalls, that firewalls could detect any of these unauthorized access to the system and would give alarm to the security administrators.
3. **Corrective Controls** -> We backup data ,so we can do the restoration.

Internal controls example:

**What are the best ways to reduce risk of fire using control?**

![[controls2.png]]

- List 15 controls to reduce the risk of fire.

**Preventative controls** -> *Use fire proof building materials*, *install sprinklers*, install escape route maps, *organize fire safety education workshops*, *get fire insurance, fire drill practices, no naked flame in the building, no smoking in the building, regular fire department inspection, regular maintenance of devices*

**Detective controls** -> *install smoke detection sensors, install fire alarms, install CCTV's*

**Corrective controls** -> *backup systems, install fire extinguishers, get fire insurance*

**Preventative Controls**

Most desire controls to reduce risk

9 -> No naked flame in the building
10 -> No smoking in the building

Why 9 is before 10 ?

-> *Preventative Controls*
1. Reduce Probability
2. Reduce Impact

## 1.7 Internal Controls Examples

**How to identify controls?**

*Step1:* Classify which control is primary -> Preventative, Detective, Corrective

*Step2:* Explain how and what **risks** do the control address ->

*Step3:* Analyse whether different controls can be applied to different situation.

**Internal Controls Example-1**

Encryption software

-> 1. Preventative
-> 2. Prevent revealing confidential information

**Internal Controls Example-2**

Job Rotation

-> Preventative Control
-> Prevent the knowledge of the system by a single employee only
-> Detective Control e.g: Banking, Societe Generale case

**Internal Controls Example-3**

System backup & restoration

-> Corrective Control
-> Backup & restore the system when needed 
-> May be as preventative control against data loss

**Internal Controls Example-4**

Password

-> Preventative control
-> Prevent danger of privileged user accounts

**Internal Controls Example-5**

A log of user

-> Detective control
-> Record & Track user activities
(e.g money transaction amount, date, time & user's authorization as audit trail)

**Internal Controls Example-6**

Security Awareness Training

-> Preventative control
-> Prevent security breaches caused by the failures of personnel (Esp. Single point of failure)

**Internal Controls Example-7**

Close circuit monitoring system (CCTV)

-> Detective controls 
-> Detect unusual activites
-> Preventative to deter employees from committing computer frauds

**Internal Controls Example-8**

Data entry controls

ID: missing ID

-> Preventative control
-> Ensure accuracy & integrity of transaction data entry

## Perform IS Auditing

### General IS Audit Procedures

![[procedures1.png]]

#### Understanding of the audit areas/subjects

**Audit areas** (financial area, airline, healthcare)
- Sensitive Information
- Common risk
- Regulations
- General IT architecture
- Control breach

**Audit subjects**
- Sensitive Information
- Policies and procedures
- Business practices
- IT architecture
- Outsource?
- Interview key managers
- Tour key organization facility
- Prior audit report
- Environment change

### Compliance Testing and Substantive Testing

**What is compliance testing?**

Determine whether employees follow **policies & procedures** of senior management and **laws & regulation** from regulators.

**Example of IT compliance**

**Policy:** Change password 1-3 months

**Compliance testing:** Check if employees follow this policy.

#### Classical case that leads to new policy

Bank account balance: $123.45

Actual bank account balance: $123.456789

6789 -> collected by programmer

Come up with new controls (policy) to reduce the risk of this kind of things happens. -> Change management

![[procedures2.png]]

![[procedures3.png]]

**Substantive testing:** Detailed analysis of the line of codes.

![[procedures4.png]]

In a normal situation, if *compliance testing pass* we don't have to do *substantive testing*. 

#### What if the company has weak or no internal controls?

Compliance testing (pass) -> Substantive testing (still require)

There should be policy of change management. Control of change management should be there but it is not there.

|Scenario|Audit Approach|
|---|---|
|Good policy + **Bad control design**|Controls are weak by design → Compliance testing is meaningless → **Substantive testing MANDATORY** ✓|
|Good policy + Good design + Not followed|Compliance testing is performed first, then substantive testing follows based on results|
|No policy|Nothing to test in this case, different category entirely|
### Evidence

**How can we obtain evidence?**

Compliance officer observations, Notes from interview, Internal documentation, Contract with external parties, result of compliance test, re-performance, confirmation

![[procedures5.png]]

![[procedures6.png]]

![[procedures7.png]]

![[procedures8.png]]

##### **What are the determinants to evaluate evidence?**

- **Independence** of the provider of the evidence

- **Qualification** of the individual providing the information or evidence

- **Objectivity** of the evidence

- **Timing** of the evidence

##### What are the techniques to get evidence?

1. Review IS organization structures
2. Review IS policies and procedures
3. Review IS documentation
4. Interview appropriate personnel
5. Observe processes and employee performance
