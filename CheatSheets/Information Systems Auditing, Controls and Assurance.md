## 1.2 Introduction to Risk in Information System

### What is Risk ?
Risk, according to my understanding, is a possibility of having a negative impact.

### Elements of risk

- **Threats** -> Natural disaster, man-made threats(internal (fraud), external (hacking)), Technical(hardware failure) 
- **Impact** -> Measure of damage
- **Probabilities** -> Likelihood of having risk

**Who can give you the highest damage ?**

*The internal man-made threats are more serious than the external ones because internal person that within the organization and of course your business process, so that they can damage you the most compared to external.

*Internal ones give more damage to the organization than external ones.

## Risk Management Process 1- Risk Assessment

What is the process of risk management ?

1. Risk Assessment
2. Risk Mitigation
3. Risk re-evaluation

### Risk Assessment

- Identify area of having high risk
- 3 elements of risk:

-Threats
-Impact
-Probabilities

**Step 1: Define Risk**

![[risk.png]]

**Step 2: Define the probability of having risk**

*e.g. based on historical data*

![[risk2.png]]

**Step 3: Identify the risk for different threats & create the risk matrix**

![[risk3.png]]

**Step 4: Rate the risk**

![[risk4.png]]

### Risk assessment example

Risk to your organization

- What is the threat?

Cyber hacking to online server

- What is the impact?

- What is the probability ?

According to instructor, 4. Serious impact: *Operation -> Breakdown of key activities leading to reduction in performance*, Probability -> *4. Likely -> The event will probably occur*

Multiply on matrix ->

## Risk Management Process 2 - Risk Mitigation

Risk mitigation means reduce the risks using controls.

### Risk mitigation example:

How can we reduce the risk of cyber hacking ?

![[risk8.png]]

![[risk9.png]]

What are the options if senior management still not happy with the existing risk?

- **Transfer the remaining risk to 3rd party (Insurance Policy)**

- **Avoid the risk** -> 

Example: we are a bank and would like to go for e-banking. It seems that e-banking is high risk for organization. We are worrying about the data lost maybe hacking to your customers information. You decided to continue with traditional banking ,but no e-banking.

**What is the difference between eliminate the risk and avoid the risk?**

Eliminate the risk means we still go for e-banking and we come up with many many controls and decide, we don't have risks at all. 

Avoid the risk means, no, we don't do e-banking, but we do traditional banking only.

not doing e-banking leads to lose customer DONT PREFERRED.

*1. Reduce the risk using control to a level acceptable by senior management*
*2. Transfer the risk to third party*
*3. Avoid the risk*

**Remember cannot eliminate**

## Risk Management Process 3 - Risk Re-evaluation

**When are we doing risk evaluation?**

Two different scenarios that we do risk re-evaluation.

- **Time Driven** -> Peridocially that means once every six months time we do the risk assessment and risk evaluation or once every year.
- **Event Driven** -> Environment change (Something changed within organisation or similar organisations), government regulation, natural disaster

Japan earthquake (nuclear plant melt down) -> envrionment change example

# Internal Controls of Information Systems (IS)

## 1.6 Identify Internal Controls

![[risk10.png]]

**What are internal controls ?**

Policies, procedures, practices and organizational structures implemented to reduce **risks**.

**==Policy & Procedure==**
Every employees must change their usernames and passwords every 3 months.

| Username | Username |
| -------- | -------- |
| johnw123 | johnw456 |

| Passwords   | Passwords |
| ----------- | --------- |
| Dlfhsji!s24 | ovldjhD13 |
**How to implement this policy ?**

![[controls1.png]]

*If no change, staff cannot access to the system*

**Internal Controls:**

1) Policy and procedures
2) Law & regulations from government

**Classification of internal controls**

1. **Preventative Controls** -> If you have antivirus software installed in your computer, whenever there could be some virus attacks to your computer. Your antivirus software is going to prevent that attack.
2. **Detective Controls** -> Sometimes security administrators keep firewalls, that firewalls could detect any of these unauthorized access to the system and would give alarm to the security administrators.
3. **Corrective Controls** -> We backup data ,so we can do the restoration.

Internal controls example:

**What are the best ways to reduce risk of fire using control?**

![[controls2.png]]

- List 15 controls to reduce the risk of fire.

**Preventative controls** -> *Use fire proof building materials*, *install sprinklers*, install escape route maps, *organize fire safety education workshops*, *get fire insurance, fire drill practices, no naked flame in the building, no smoking in the building, regular fire department inspection, regular maintenance of devices*

**Detective controls** -> *install smoke detection sensors, install fire alarms, install CCTV's*

**Corrective controls** -> *backup systems, install fire extinguishers, get fire insurance*

**Preventative Controls**

Most desire controls to reduce risk

9 -> No naked flame in the building
10 -> No smoking in the building

Why 9 is before 10 ?

-> *Preventative Controls*
1. Reduce Probability
2. Reduce Impact
