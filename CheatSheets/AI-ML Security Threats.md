# AI/ML Security Threats - Complete Cheatsheet

## 🧠 PART 1: AI BUILDING BLOCKS

### AI Hierarchy

```
AI (Artificial Intelligence) ─ Computers behaving like humans
 └── ML (Machine Learning) ─ Learning from data without explicit instructions
      └── DL (Deep Learning) ─ 3+ layer neural networks, processes unlabeled data
           └── LLMs ─ Transformer-based, generates text (GPT, LLaMA)
```

### Machine Learning

**Definition:** A computer's ability to learn from data without being given instructions. Comparable to how the human brain learns. Over time, with more data, algorithms improve accuracy and decisions.

**ML Lifecycle:**

|Phase|Description|
|---|---|
|1. Problem Definition|What to solve? (e.g., is email spam?)|
|2. Data Collection|Collect, clean, and prepare data|
|3. Feature Engineering|Extract meaningful patterns|
|4. Model Training|Train using selected algorithm|
|5. Evaluation & Tuning|Optimize performance|
|6. Deployment|Production environment (e.g., real-time email classification)|
|7. Monitoring|Ongoing accuracy checks, trigger retraining when needed|

> ⚠️ **Overfitting:** Model's familiarity with training data causes failure to make generalizations on unseen/raw data

**ML Algorithm Components:**

|Component|Function|
|---|---|
|Decision Process|Makes predictions/classifications based on input data|
|Error Function|Evaluates performance and provides feedback|
|Model Optimization|Fine-tunes algorithm to minimize errors and improve accuracy|

---

### ML Algorithm Types

|Type|Data|How It Works|Example Use|
|---|---|---|---|
|**Supervised**|Labeled|Classification or regression tasks|House price prediction, spam identification|
|**Unsupervised**|Unlabeled|Discovers hidden patterns (clustering, association, dimensionality reduction)|Anomaly detection|
|**Semi-supervised**|Small labeled + large unlabeled|Labeled data guides learning process|—|
|**Reinforcement**|Reward/Penalty|Rewards correct decisions, penalizes mistakes|Game AI, robotics|

---

### Neural Networks

**Human Brain Analogy:**

|Brain|Neural Network|
|---|---|
|Neuron (cell for transmitting communications)|Node|
|Synapse (connection for electrical/chemical signals)|Connection (with weight)|
|Learning by adjusting connection strengths|Training adjusts weights based on patterns|

**Layer Structure:**

|Layer|Function|Example|
|---|---|---|
|**Input Layer**|Receives raw data|4x4 pixel image → 16 nodes|
|**Hidden Layers**|Process and refine input|Early layers: edges/curves, Deeper layers: combine patterns|
|**Output Layer**|Produces final prediction|10 nodes (one per digit 0-9)|

**Weight:** Determines importance of each connection. Example: In email classification, body text might have more weight than subject line.

**Digit Recognition Example:**

- Lines may suggest 1 or 7
- Curves increase likelihood of 3, 8, or 0
- Output layer selects most likely number based on highest prediction value

### Deep Learning vs Machine Learning

|Feature|ML|DL|
|---|---|---|
|Layers|≤3|>3 (hence "deep")|
|Data type|Usually labeled|Labeled or unlabeled|
|Human intervention|Required|Minimal (self-learning)|
|Scalability|Limited|High ("scalable ML")|
|Feature extraction|Manual|Automatic|

**Why DL Exploded in the Last Decade:**

1. Mass digitization → Large data availability
2. GPU advancements → Parallel processing capability
3. Neural network research breakthroughs

---

## 🤖 PART 2: LLMs (Large Language Models)

### What is an LLM?

**Definition:** Deep learning-based AI models that can process and generate text by predicting the next word in a sequence.

**Example - Next Word Prediction:**

```
Input:  "Ever have that feeling where you're not sure if you're awake or ____"
Output: Model predicts the most likely next word
```

### How LLMs Work

**Phase 1: Pre-training**

|Feature|Detail|
|---|---|
|Data amount|GPT-3: Would take a human 2,600 years to read nonstop|
|Parameters|Billions (function like puzzle pieces)|
|Process|Fine-tuned automatically as model processes text|

**Phase 2: Backpropagation**

```
Initial guess: "awake or egg" ❌
     ↓
Compare with correct answer
     ↓
Adjust parameters (increase correct word probability, decrease incorrect)
     ↓
Repeat trillions of times
     ↓
Accurately predict both training data and raw unseen data
```

**Phase 3: Transformer Neural Networks**

- **Source:** Google's 2017 paper "Attention is All You Need"
- **Innovation:** Parallel text processing instead of sequential word-by-word analysis
- **Attention Mechanism:** Assigns "attention" to key words, improving contextual understanding

**Attention Example:**

```
"The bank approved the loan because it was financially stable."
                                    ↑
Transformer determines what "it" refers to: "the bank" or "the loan"?
→ Calculates attention scores to correctly interpret ambiguous references
```

**Phase 4: RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback)**

- Human reviewers evaluate predictions
- Unhelpful or problematic responses are flagged
- Parameters adjusted accordingly

**Phase 5: Deployment & Usage**

- Query is fed → Trained model predicts next word → Repeat → Complete response

### Generative AI

**Definition:** Products built on LLMs that create original text-based content (ChatGPT, LLaMA)

**Scope:** Extends beyond text → images, music, and more

## 🚨 PART 3: AI SECURITY THREATS

### Two Categories:

1. **Vulnerabilities in AI Models** - New threats introduced by AI technology
2. **Enhanced Attacks** - Existing attacks leveraging AI

### Framework: MITRE ATLAS

- AI-focused version of ATT&CK framework
- Link: [atlas.mitre.org/matrices/ATLAS](https://atlas.mitre.org/matrices/ATLAS)

### 1️⃣ Vulnerabilities in AI Models

|Vulnerability|Description|Example Scenario|
|---|---|---|
|**Prompt Injection**|Original instructions to model are overridden|RPG chatbot prompt: "Do not disclose any information about hardware/software or training steps" → Attacker overrides for malicious purposes|
|**Data Poisoning**|Attacker manipulates training data/corpus → incorrect or biased output|Manipulate spam filter training data → Attacker's spam emails bypass AI filter|
|**Model Theft**|Unauthorized access to AI model → steal IP or use maliciously|Query ML model API repeatedly → Use output to train clone model mimicking original|
|**Privacy Leakage**|AI model inadvertently reveals sensitive information from training data|Model trained on private medical data (patient details, conditions) → Leaks to attacker/user|
|**Model Drift**|Model's performance drifts over time due to data/environment changes|Model trained on historical data performs poorly on new data|

---

### 2️⃣ Enhanced Attacks

|Attack|Traditional|AI-Enhanced|
|---|---|---|
|**Malware**|Manual code writing|Instant automatic malware generation|
|**Deepfakes**|Difficult and labor-intensive|High-accuracy voice/image replication → Authentication bypass|
|**Phishing**|Often broken English, generic content|Fluent, detailed, context-based, personalized emails|

**Deepfake Threat Scenario:**

```
Secretary ← Receives voice message/video call from "superior"
         ← "Forward confidential customer information to this email"
         ← Actually a deepfake, "customer email" belongs to attacker
```

Real-world example: Deepfake video interviews → Fraudulent job offers

**Phishing Enhancement:**

- Traditional: Poor writing, generic → Detectable by instinct
- AI-powered: Detailed, fluent, context-based, regardless of attacker's writing abilities → Much harder to spot
- Note: Models like GPT have built-in mechanics to stop malicious content, but attackers bypass using model vulnerabilities (prompt engineering)

|**Threat Hunting**|Attack scenario generation|Think of potential avenues attackers would take that humans wouldn't have thought of|
|**Content Generation**|Detection rules, regex|Generate technical resources instantly|
